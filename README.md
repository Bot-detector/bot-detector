This plugin pulls surrounding Player Names from Old School RuneScape. It then sends those names to a Python server that looks up those names on the hiscores - and runs a neural network analysis on the returned player stats to analyze bot-like behavior. Bot-like players are then separately reported to Jagex. 

--HOW TO USE--
1. Turn on the Plugin
2. Run around and collect player names automatically
3. Turn off the plugin - or allow for automatic sending in Bot-Detector > Config
4. Have notifications on in RuneLite > Notification Settings: Enable Tray Notifications & Game Message Notifications in order to know when your names have sent!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roadmap For Future Updates:
- Allow for players to recieve updates on the names that they have identified/come across in game.
- Highlight players that have already been scanned in-game
- Add labels to group IDs
