This plugin pulls surrounding Player Names from Old School RuneScape. It then sends those names to a Python server that looks up those names on the hiscores - and runs a Meachine Learning analysis on the returned player stats to analyze bot-like behavior. Bot-like players are then separately reported to Jagex.
